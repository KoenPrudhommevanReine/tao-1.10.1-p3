  
Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO)

This is the main directory of the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization.
This is work in progress, so changes in the interface will occur in
the future.  For the most up-to-date TAO information, see the web page
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao

Contents:
 - include       - public include files
 - src           - source code
 - lib           - compiled libraries
 - docs          - documentation
 - maint         - maintenance utilities
 - bmake         - makefile utilities

All library source code is within the source directory (src) and is
organized by the type of optimization problem, including
 - interface     - general TAO interface
 - bound         - bound constrained minimization
 - unconstrained - unconstrained minimization
Some additional tools are also available:
 - supplements   - supplementary tools
 - fortran       - fortran interface
Additional categories of optimization software (e.g., least squares,
more general constrained optimization, etc.) are under development
and will be included in future releases.
