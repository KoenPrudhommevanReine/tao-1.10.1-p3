The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) focuses on large-scale optimization software, including nonlinear least squares, unconstrained minimization,
bound constrained optimization, and general nonlinear optimization. The solution of such problems pervades many areas of computational science and
demands robust and flexible solution strategies.

This is a web based introduction for the TAO tutorial examples. It uses HTML versions
of source code, sample output, and makefiles to allow you to quickly go from elementary TAO examples to more complex problems.
