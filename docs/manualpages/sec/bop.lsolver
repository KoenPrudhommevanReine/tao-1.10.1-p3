<H2> TaoLinearSolver Methods and Manual Pages
</H2>

TAO uses an abstract class called TaoLinearSolvers to represent 
linear equation solvers.  
Examples of these solvers include the conjugate gradient method
and GMRES.  These
operators act on vectors and matrices and have methods,
which can be used within an optimization solver or application code.
These methods are virtual functions whose implementation depends upon
upon the internal representation of the data.
