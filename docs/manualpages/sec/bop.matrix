TAO uses an abstract class called TaoMat to represent linear operators.  
Examples of 
linear operators are a Hessian matrix, Jacobian matrix, 
and projection matrices.  These
operators act on vectors and have methods
which can be used within an optimization solver or application code.
These methods are virtual functions whose implementation depends upon
upon the internal representation of the data.
