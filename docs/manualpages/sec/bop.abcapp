These routines allow the application developers to solve
optimization problems using gradient based methods one processor.
The vectors are represented as an array of doubles.  The application
developer must write a constructor the optimization object that declares
the number of variables, and the method for evaluating the function and
gradient.  The application may also specify bounds on the variables and
an initial starting point.
