<H2> TaoVec Methods and Manual Pages
</H2>

TAO uses a vector class called TaoVec to represent the variables 
of an optimization problem.  This class has methods that
can be used within an optimization solver or application code.
The methods are virtual functions whose implementation depends upon
upon the internal representation of the data.
