\section{Concluding Remarks}

We have presented preliminary results for \tao\ on
mesh-based problems for an obstacle problem. 
%for a minimal surface problem. 
A more extensive study
of the performance of \tao\ algorithms on mesh-based
problems is planned.

Version 1.6 of \tao\ includes all the features
that we have discussed, in particular,
mesh sequencing via Distributed Arrays (DA),
and generation of gradients of mesh functions with ADIC.
The \tao\ software \cite{tao-home} includes
source code, documentation, tutorials, and sample problems.
