The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) focuses on the design and  
implementation of optimization software for the  
solution of large-scale optimization applications on high-performance  
architectures.  Our approach is motivated by the scattered support for  
parallel computations and lack of reuse of linear algebra software in  
currently available optimization software.  The TAO design allows the  
reuse of toolkits that provide lower-level support (parallel sparse  
matrix data structures, preconditioners, solvers), and thus we are  
able to build on top of these toolkits instead of having to redevelop  
code. The advantages in terms of efficiency and development time are  
significant.  
<P> 
The TAO design philosophy uses object-oriented techniques of data and  
state encapsulation, abstract classes, and limited inheritance to  
create a flexible optimization toolkit.  This chapter provides a short  
introduction to our design philosophy by describing the objects in TAO  
and the importance of this design.  Since a major concern in the TAO  
project is the performance and scalability of optimization algorithms  
on large problems, we also present some performance resuls.
