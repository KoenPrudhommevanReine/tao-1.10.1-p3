<TITLE>Basic Usage of TAO Solvers</TITLE>

<HR><H1><A NAME="Node25">18. Basic Usage of TAO Solvers</a></H1>
  
<P> 
TAO contains unconstrained minimization, bound constrained minimization,   
and nonlinear complementarity solvers.  
The structure of these problems can differ significantly,   
but TAO has a similar interface to all of its solvers.    
Routines that most solvers have in common will be discussed in   
this chapter.  
A complete list of options can be found by consulting the manual pages.  
Many of the options can also be set at the command line.  These options  
can also be found in manual pages or by  
running a program with the <tt> -help</tt> option.
