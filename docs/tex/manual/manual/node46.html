TAO applications written in C/C++ should have the statement   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   #include "tao.h" 
</tt></pre> 
  
in each file that uses a routine in the TAO libraries.  
All of the required lower level include files such as ``tao_solver.h''  
and ``taoapp.h''  
are automatically included within this high-level file.
