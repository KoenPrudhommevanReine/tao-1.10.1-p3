<TITLE>Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method</TITLE>

<P> 
The nonlinear conjugate gradient method can be viewed as an extensions of the   
conjugate gradient method for solving symmetric, positive-definite linear   
systems of equations.  This algorithm requires only function and gradient   
evaluations as well as a line search.  The TAO implementation uses a   
More-Thuente line search to obtain the step length.  The nonlinear   
conjugate gradient method can be selected by using the TaoMethod   
<tt> tao_cg</tt>.  For the best efficiency, function and gradient evaluations   
should be performed simultaneously when using this algorithm.  
<P> 
Five variations are currently supported by the TAO implementation: the   
Fletcher-Reeves method, the Polak-Ribi&#233;re method, the Polak-Ribi&#233;re-Plus   
method[(ref NW99)], the Hestenes-Stiefel method, and the Dai-Yuan method.    
These conjugate gradient methods can be specified by using the command line   
argument <tt> tao_cg_type &lt;fr,pr,prp,hs,dy&gt;</tt>, respectively.  The default   
value is <tt> prp</tt>.    
<P> 
The conjugate gradient method incorporates automatic restarts when successive   
gradients are not sufficiently orthogonal.  TAO measures the orthogonality by   
dividing the inner product of the gradient at the current point and the   
gradient at the previous point by the square of the Euclidean norm of   
the gradient at the current point.  When the absolute value of this   
ratio is greater than <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img65.xbm">
, the algorithm restarts using the gradient   
direction.  The parameter <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img66.xbm">
 can be set using the command line argument   
<tt> -tao_cg_eta &lt;double&gt;</tt>; 0.1 is the default value.
