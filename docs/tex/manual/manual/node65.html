The TAO library currently interfaces to the PETSc library for  
low-level system functionality as well as linear algebra support.  The  
PETSc users manual discusses additional Fortran issues in these areas,  
including  
<ul> 
 
<li>array arguments (e.g., <tt> VecGetArray()</tt>),  
 
<li>calling Fortran Routines from C (and C Routines from Fortran),  
 
<li>passing null pointers,  
 
<li>duplicating multiple vectors, and  
 
<li>matrix and vector indices.  
</ul>
