Once the application object has the   
objective function, constraints, derivatives, and other features associated with it,  
a TAO solver can be applied to the application.    
For further information about how to create a TAO solver, see the previous chapter.  
<P> 
Once the TAO solver and TAO application object have been created and customized,   
they can be matched with one another  
using the routine   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSetupApplicationSolver.html#TaoSetupApplicationSolver">TaoSetupApplicationSolver</a>( TAO_APPLICATION, TAO_SOLVER); 
</tt></pre> 
  
This routine will set up the TAO solver for the application.    
Different solvers may set up differently, but they typically  
create the work vectors and linear solvers needed to find a solution.    
These structures were not created  
during the creation of the solver because the size of the application  
was not known.  
After calling this routine  
the routine <tt>  TaoAppGetTaoSolver()</tt> can be used to obtain  
the TAO solver object.  If not called directly by the application,   
<tt> <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSetupApplicationSolver.html#TaoSetupApplicationSolver">TaoSetupApplicationSolver</a>()</tt> will be executed inside of the  
subroutine <tt> <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSolveApplication.html#TaoSolveApplication">TaoSolveApplication</a>()</tt>.  
<P> 
The routine   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   TaoGetGradientVec( TAO_SOLVER, Vec*); 
</tt></pre> 
  
will set a pointer to a <tt> Vec</tt> to the vector object containing  
the gradient vector and the  routine  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoGetVariableBoundVecs.html#TaoGetVariableBoundVecs">TaoGetVariableBoundVecs</a>( TAO_SOLVER, Vec*, Vec*); 
</tt></pre> 
  
will set the pointers to the lower and upper bounds on the variables  -- if   
they exist.  These vectors may be viewed at before, during, and after  
the solver is running.  
<P> 
Options for the application and solver   
can be be set from the command line using the routine    
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSetOptions.html#TaoSetOptions">TaoSetOptions</a>( TAO_APPLICATION, TAO_SOLVER); 
</tt></pre> 
This routine will call  <tt> <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSetupApplicationSolver.html#TaoSetupApplicationSolver">TaoSetupApplicationSolver</a>()</tt> if it has not been  
called already.  
This command also provides information about runtime options when the  
user includes the <tt> -help </tt> option on the  
command line.  
<P> 
Once the application and solver have been set up, the solver can be called using the routine  
  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSolveApplication.html#TaoSolveApplication">TaoSolveApplication</a>( TAO_APPLICATION, TAO_SOLVER); 
</tt></pre> 
  
This  routine will call the TAO solver.  If the routine  <tt> <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSetupApplicationSolver.html#TaoSetupApplicationSolver">TaoSetupApplicationSolver</a>()</tt>  
has not already been called, this routine will call it.  
<P> 
After a solution has been found, the routine  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoCopyDualsOfVariableBounds.html#TaoCopyDualsOfVariableBounds">TaoCopyDualsOfVariableBounds</a>( TAO_APPLICATION, Vec, Vec ); 
</tt></pre> 
  
can compute the dual values of the variables bounds and copy them  
into the vectors passed into this routine.
