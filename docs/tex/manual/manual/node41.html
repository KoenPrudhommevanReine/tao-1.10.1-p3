<HR><H2><A NAME="Node41">25.4. Limited Memory Variable Metric Method</a></H2>
This method is the bound constrained variant of the LMVM method for  
unconstrained optimization.  It uses projected gradients to approximate  
the Hessian -- eliminating the need for Hessian evaluations.  
The method can be set using  TaoMethod <tt> tao_blmvm</tt>.  
The command <tt> TaoLMVMSetSize()</tt>, which sets the number  
of vectors to be used in the Hessian approximation,   
also applies to this method.
