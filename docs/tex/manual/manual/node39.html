The GPCG [(ref more-toraldo)] algorithm is much like the TRON algorithm, discussed in  
Section , except that  
it assumes that the objective function is quadratic and convex.  
Therefore, it evaluates the function, gradient, and Hessian only  
once.  
Since the objective function  
is quadratic, the algorithm does not use a trust region.    
All of the options that apply to TRON, except for trust region  
options,  also apply to GPCG.
