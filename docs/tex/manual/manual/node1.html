The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) focuses on the development  
of algorithms and software for the solution of large-scale  
optimization problems on high-performance architectures.  Areas of  
interest include nonlinear least squares, unconstrained and  
bound-constrained optimization, and general nonlinear optimization.  
<P> 
The development of TAO was motivated by the scattered support for  
parallel computations and the lack of reuse of external toolkits in  
current optimization software.  Our aim is to use object-oriented  
techniques to produce high-quality optimization software for a range  
of computing environments ranging from serial workstations and laptops  
to massively parallel high-performance architectures.  Our design  
decisions are strongly motivated by the challenges inherent in the use  
of large-scale distributed memory architectures and the reality of  
working with large, often poorly structured legacy codes for specific  
applications.  
<P> 
This manual describes the use of TAO.  
Since TAO is still under development, changes in usage and  
calling sequences may occur.  TAO is fully supported; see the  
the web site http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao for information on  
contacting the TAO developers.
