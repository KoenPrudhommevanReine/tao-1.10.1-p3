The routine  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   int <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSolveApplication.html#TaoSolveApplication">TaoSolveApplication</a>(TAO_APPLICATION, TAO_SOLVER); 
</tt></pre> 
  
will apply the solver to the application that has been created by the user.  
<P> 
To see parameters and performance statistics for the solver, the  
routine  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   int <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoView.html#TaoView">TaoView</a>(TAO_SOLVER); 
</tt></pre> 
can be used.  This routine will display to standard output the number  
of function evaluations need by the solver and other information  
specific to the solver.  
<P> 
The progress of the optimization solver can be monitored with  
the runtime option <tt> -tao_monitor</tt>.  Although monitoring routines  
can be customized, the default monitoring routine will print out   
several relevant statistics to the screen.  
<P> 
The user also has access to information about the current solution.  
The current iteration number, objective function value, gradient  
norm, infeasibility norm, and step length   
can be retrieved with the command   
  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   int <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetSolutionStatus.html#TaoGetSolutionStatus">TaoGetSolutionStatus</a>(TAO_SOLVER tao, int* iterate, double* f,  
                            double* gnorm, double *cnorm, double *xdiff,  
                            TaoTerminateReason *reason) 
</tt></pre> 
  
The last argument returns  
a code that indicates the reason that the solver terminated.  Positive   
numbers indicate that a solution has been found, while negative numbers  
indicate a failure.  A list of reasons can be found in the manual page  
for <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetTerminationReason.html#TaoGetTerminationReason">TaoGetTerminationReason</a>()</tt>.  
<P> 
The user set  
vectors containing the solution and gradient before solving  
the problem, but pointers to these vectors can also be retrieved with the  
commands <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetSolution.html#TaoGetSolution">TaoGetSolution</a>()</tt>  
and <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetGradient.html#TaoGetGradient">TaoGetGradient</a>()</tt>.    
Dual variables and other relevant information are also available.   
This information can be obtained during  
user-defined routines such as a function evaluation and customized  
monitoring routine, or after the solver has terminated.
