<TITLE>Compiling and Running TAO</TITLE>

<P> 
Compilation of the TAO numerical libraries and TAO application codes  
requires three environmental variables to be set.  These three  
variables, <tt> TAO_DIR</tt>, <tt> PETSC_ARCH</tt>, and <tt> PETSC_DIR</tt>,  
are discussed more fully in the TAO installation instructions.  
<P> 
TAO uses a portable makefile system provided by the  
PETSc [(ref petsc-web-page),(ref petsc-user-ref)] library, which is discussed  
further in Section .  The TAO library can be  
compiled with the command  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   make 
</tt></pre> 
  
from the <tt> TAO_DIR</tt> directory.    
<P> 
Running a TAO application on a single processor can be done in the  
usual way by entering the name of the executable and any command line  
options.  Running programs in parallel, however, requires use of the  
MPI library.  All TAO programs use the MPI (Message Passing Interface)  
standard for message-passing communication [(ref MPI-final)].  Thus, to  
execute TAO programs, users must know the procedure for beginning MPI  
jobs on their selected computer system(s).  For instance, when using  
the MPICH implementation of MPI [(ref mpich-web-page)] and many others,  
the following command initiates a program that uses eight processors:  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>  mpirun -np 8 tao_program_name tao_options 
</tt></pre>
