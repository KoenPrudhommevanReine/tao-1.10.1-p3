TAO can be used on a personal  
computer with a single processor or within a parallel environment.    
Its basic usage involves only a few commands, but fully   
understanding its usage requires time.  
Application programmers can easily begin to use TAO by working with   
some examples provides in the package  
and then gradually learn more details according to  
their needs.  The current version of TAO and the most recent help   
concerning the installation and usage of TAO can be found at    
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/.  
<P> 
The current version (1.10.1) of TAO requires an ANSI C++ compiler,   
an implementation of MPI, Version 3.1 of PETSc compiled with the C++   
compiler, (PETSc must be configured with the <tt> --with-clanguage=C++</tt>  
option) and at   
least 15 MB of free disk space.  
During the setup process, the user will have to set an environmental  
variable, <tt> TAO_DIR</tt>, indicating the full path of   
the TAO home directory.  
This variable will be used in this  
manual to refer to the location of files, and by computers that  
will compile TAO source code.
