The Nelder-Mead algorithm [(ref nelder.mead:simplex)] is a direct search method for finding a local  
minimum of a function <I>f(x)</I>.  This algorithm does not require any gradient or Hessian   
information of <I>f</I>, and therefore has some expected advantages and disadvantages compared  
to the other TAO solvers.  The obvious advantage is that it is easier to write an   
application when no derivatives need to be calculated.  The downside is that this algorithm can  
be very slow to converge or can even stagnate, and performs poorly for large numbers of variables.  
<P> 
This solver keeps a set of <I>N+1</I> sorted vectors <I>x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>,...,x<SUB>N+1</SUB></I> and their corresponding   
objective function values <IMG WIDTH=99 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img16.xbm">
.  At each iteration, <I>x<SUB>N+1</SUB></I> is removed from  
the set and replaced with   
<P><IMG WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=32 SRC="img17.xbm"><P>
    
 <P> 
where <IMG WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img18.xbm">
 can be one of <IMG WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=13 SRC="img19.xbm">
 depending upon the values of   
each possible <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img20.xbm">
.  
<P> 
The algorithm terminates when the residual  <I>f<SUB>N+1</SUB> - f<SUB>1</SUB></I> becomes sufficiently small.  Because of   
the way new vectors can be added to the sorted set,   
the minimum function value and/or the residual may not be impacted at each iteration.  
<P> 
There are two options that can be set specifically for the Nelder-Mead algorithm,  
<tt> -tao_nm_lamda &lt;value&gt;</tt> sets the initial set of vectors (<I>x<SUB>0</SUB></I> plus   
<tt> value</tt> in each cartesion direction), the default value is <I>1</I>.    
<tt> tao_nm_mu &lt;value&gt;</tt> sets the value of <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img21.xbm">
,   
the default is <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img22.xbm">
.
