<TITLE>Bounds on Variables</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<HR><H1><A NAME="Node54">34. Bounds on Variables</a></H1>
  
<P> 
Some optimization problems also impose constraints upon the variables.  
The constraints may impose simple bounds upon the variables, or  
require that the variables satisfy a set of linear or  nonlinear equations.  
<P> 
The simplest type of constraint upon an optimization problem puts lower  
or upper bounds upon the variables.   
Vectors that represent lower and upper bounds for each variable   
can be set with the command    
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoAppSetVariableBoundsRoutine.html#TaoAppSetVariableBoundsRoutine">TaoAppSetVariableBoundsRoutine</a>(TAO_APPLICATION,  
                          int (*)(TAO_APPLICATION, Vec,Vec,void*),void *); 
</tt></pre> 
  
The first vector and second vectors should contain the lower and upper   
bounds, respectively.  
When no upper or lower bound exists for a variable, the bound  
may be set to <tt> TAO_INFINITY</tt> or <tt> TAO_NINFINITY</tt>.  
After the two bound vectors have been set, they may be accessed with the  
with the command  <tt> TaoGetApplicationVariableBounds()</tt>.  
Since not all solvers use bounds on variables, the user must be careful   
to select a type of solver that acknowledges these bounds.
