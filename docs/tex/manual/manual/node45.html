<P> 
The solvers in TAO address applications that have a set of variables, an objective  
function, and constraints on the variables.  Many solvers also require derivatives  
of the objective and constraint functions.  
To use the TAO solvers, the application developer must   
define a set of variables, implement routines that evaluate the   
objective function and constraint functions, and pass this information  
to a TAO application object.     
<P> 
TAO uses vector and matrix objects to pass this information from the  
application to the solver.   The set of variables, for instance, is  
represented in a vector.  
The gradient of an objective function <IMG WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img144.xbm">
,  
evaluated at a point, is also represented as a vector.  
Matrices,  on the other hand,  
can be used to represent the Hessian of <I>f</I> or the Jacobian of a constraint  
function <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img145.xbm">
.  The TAO solvers use  
these objects to compute a solution to the application.  
<P> 
The PETSc package provides parallel and serial implementations of these  
objects and offers additional tools intended for high-performance   
scientific applications.  
The <b> Vec</b> and <b> Mat</b> types in PETSc  
represent the vectors and matrices in a TAO application.  
This chapter will describe how to create these an application object  
and give it the necessary properties.  This chapter will also describe how to use  
the TAO solvers in conjunction with this application object.
