The TRON [(ref lin_c3)] algorithm is an active set method that uses a   
combination of gradient projections and   
a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to minimize an objective function.  
Each iteration of the TRON algorithm requires function, gradient,   
and Hessian evaluations.  In each iteration, the algorithm  
first applies several conjugate  
gradients.    
After these iterates, the TRON solver momentarily ignores the variables  
that equal one of its bounds and  
applies a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to a  
quadratic model of the free variables.    
<P> 
The TRON algorithm solves a reduced linear system  
defined by the rows and columns corresponding to the variables that  
lie between the upper and lower bounds.  
When running in parallel, these rows can either remain on  
their current processor or be redistributed evenly over all of the  
processors with the command <tt> <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoSelectSubset.html#TaoSelectSubset">TaoSelectSubset</a>()</tt>.  
The TRON algorithm applies a trust region to the   
conjugate gradients to ensure convergence.  The initial trust region  
can be set using the command   
<tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoSetTrustRegionRadius.html#TaoSetTrustRegionRadius">TaoSetTrustRegionRadius</a>()</tt>  
and the current trust region size can be found using the command  
<tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetTrustRegionRadius.html#TaoGetTrustRegionRadius">TaoGetTrustRegionRadius</a>().</tt>  
The initial trust region can significantly alter the   
rate of convergence for the algorithm and should be  
tuned and adjusted for optimal performance.
