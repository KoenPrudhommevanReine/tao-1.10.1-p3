<P> 
Mixed complementarity problems, or box-constrained variational inequalities,  
are related to nonlinear systems of equations.  They are defined by a   
continuously differentiable function,  
<IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=8 SRC="img102.xbm">
, and bounds, <IMG WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img103.xbm">
   
and <IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img104.xbm">
, on the variables such that   
<IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img105.xbm">
.  Given this information, <IMG WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img106.xbm">
 is a solution to   
MCP(<I>F</I>, <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img107.xbm">
, <I>u</I>) if for each <IMG WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img108.xbm">
 we have at  
least one of the following:  
<P><IMG SRC="img109.xbm"><P>
Note that when <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img110.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img111.xbm">
 we have a   
nonlinear system of equations, and <IMG WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img112.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img113.xbm">
   
corresponds to the nonlinear complementarity problem [(ref cottle:nonlinear)].  
<P> 
Simple complementarity conditions arise from the first-order optimality   
conditions from optimization [(ref karush:minima),(ref  kuhn.tucker:nonlinear)].    
In the simple bound constrained optimization case, these conditions   
correspond to MCP(<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img114.xbm">
, <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img115.xbm">
, <I>u</I>), where <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img116.xbm">
   
is the objective function.  In a one-dimensional setting these conditions   
are intuitive.  If the solution is at the lower bound, then the function must   
be increasing and <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img117.xbm">
.  However, if the solution is at the   
upper bound, then the function must be decreasing and <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img118.xbm">
.    
Finally, if the solution   
is strictly between the bounds, we must be at a stationary point and   
<IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img119.xbm">
.  Other complementarity problems arise in economics and   
engineering [(ref ferris.pang:engineering)], game   
theory [(ref nash:equilibrium)], and finance [(ref huang.pang:option)].  
<P> 
Evaluation routines for <I>F</I> and its Jacobian must be supplied prior  
to solving the application.  
The bounds, <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img120.xbm">
, on the variables must also be   
provided.    
If no starting point is supplied, a default starting point of all zeros   
is used.
