A TAO solver can be created with  
the command   
  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   info = <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoCreate.html#TaoCreate">TaoCreate</a>(MPI_Comm comm,TaoMethod method,TAO_SOLVER *newsolver); 
</tt></pre> 
  
The first argument in this routine is an MPI communicator indicating which  
processes are involved in the solution process.  In  
most cases, this should be set to <tt> MPI_COMM_WORLD</tt>.  
The second argument in this creation routine   
specifies the default method that should be be used to  
solve the optimization problem.    
The third argument in <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoCreate.html#TaoCreate">TaoCreate</a>()</tt> is a pointer to a TAO solver  
object.  This routine creates the object and returns it to the user.  
The TAO object is then to be used in all TAO routines.  
<P> 
The various types of TAO solvers and the flags that identify them   
will be discussed in the following chapters.  
The solution method should be carefully chosen depending upon  
the problem that is being solved.  Some solvers, for instance, are meant for  
problems with no constraints, while other solvers acknowledge constraints  
in the problem and solve them accordingly.  
The user must also be aware of the derivative information that is available.  
Some solvers require second-order information, while other solvers require  
only gradient or function information.  
The <tt> TaoMethod</tt> can also be set to <tt> TAO_NULL</tt> in the   
<tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoCreate.html#TaoCreate">TaoCreate</a>()</tt> routine if the user selects a method at runtime using  
the options database.  
The command line option <tt> -tao_method</tt> followed by an TAO method  
will override any method specified by the second argument.  
The command line option <tt> -tao_method tao_lmvm</tt>, for instance,  
will specify the limited memory variable metric method for unconstrained  
optimization.  Note that the <tt> TaoMethod</tt> variable is a string that requires  
quotation marks in an application program, but quotation marks are not required  
at the command line.  
The method that TAO uses to solve an optimization problem can be changed at a later point  
in the program with the command  
 <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoSetMethod.html#TaoSetMethod">TaoSetMethod</a>()</tt>, whose  
arguments are a TAO solver  
and a string that uniquely identifies a method for solving the problem.  
<P> 
Each TAO solver that has been created should also be destroyed using  
the command   
  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   info = <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoDestroy.html#TaoDestroy">TaoDestroy</a>(TAO_SOLVER solver); 
</tt></pre> 
   
This routine frees the internal data structures used by the solver.
