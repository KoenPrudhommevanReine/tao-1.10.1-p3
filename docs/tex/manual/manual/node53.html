TAO fully supports matrix-free methods. The matrices specified in the  
Hessian evaluation routine need not be conventional  
matrices; instead, they can point to the data required to implement a  
particular matrix-free method.  The matrix-free variant is allowed  
<em> only</em> when the linear systems are solved by an iterative method  
in combination with no preconditioning (<tt> PCNONE</tt> or <tt> -pc_type none</tt>),  
a user-provided preconditioner matrix, or a user-provided preconditioner  
shell (<tt> PCSHELL</tt>); that is,  
obviously matrix-free methods cannot be used if a direct solver is to   
be employed. Details about using matrix-free methods are provided in the  
PETSc  Users Manual.
