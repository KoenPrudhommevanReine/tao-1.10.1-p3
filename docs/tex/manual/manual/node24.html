The home directory of TAO contains the following subdirectories:  
<P> 
<ul> 
 
<li><tt> docs</tt> - All documentation for TAO. The files <tt> tao_manual.ps</tt>  
                   and <tt> manual/manual.html</tt> contain the users manual in  
                   PDF and HTML formats, respectively. Includes  
                   the subdirectory  
  - <tt> manualpages</tt> (manual pages for individual TAO routines).  
 
<li><tt> bmake</tt> - Base TAO makefile directory.    
 
<li><tt> include</tt> - All include files for TAO that are visible to the user.  
 
<li><tt> examples</tt> - Example problems and makefile.  
 
<li><tt> src</tt> - The source code for all TAO components, which  
                  currently includes  
 <ul> 
  
<li><tt> unconstrained</tt> - unconstrained minimization,  
  
<li><tt> bound</tt> - bound constrained minimization.  
  
<li><tt> complementarity</tt> - mixed complementarity solvers.  
  
<li><tt> least_squares</tt> - nonlinear least squares,  
 </ul> 
<BR> 
</ul> 
<BR> 
  
Each TAO source code component directory has the following subdirectories:  
<ul> 
 
<li><tt> examples</tt> - Example programs for the component, including  
  <ul> 
   
<li><tt> tutorials</tt> - Programs designed to teach users about TAO.  These  
          codes can serve as templates for the design of custom applicatinos.  
   
<li><tt> tests</tt> - Programs designed for thorough testing of TAO.  As such,  
          these codes are not intended for examination by users.  
  </ul> 
<BR> 
 
<li><tt> interface</tt> - The calling sequences for the abstract interface    
        to the component.  
        Code here does not know about particular implementations.  
 
<li><tt> impls</tt> - Source code for one or more implementations.  
 
<li><tt> utils</tt> - Utility routines.  Source here may know about the   
          implementations, but ideally will not know about implementations  
          for other components.  
</ul>
