<P> 
Many solver in TAO require a line search.  While these solver always  
offer a default line search, alternative line searches can also be used.  
Line searches must have the form:  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>    int L(TAO_SOLVER tao,TaoVec *xx,TaoVec *gg,TaoVec *dx, TaoVec *ww, 
          double *f, double *step,double *gdx,int *flg,void *lsctx); 
</tt></pre> 
In this routine the first argument is the TAO solver, the second argument  
is the current solution vector, the third argument is the gradient at  
the current point, the fourth argument is the step direction, the fourth  
vector is a work vector, the fifth argument is the function value, the  
sixth argument is the step length, the seventh argument is the inner  
product of the gradient and direction vector used for the Armijo condition,  
the eighth argument is a flag indicating success or  
failure of the line search, and the last argument is a pointer to  
a structure that can be used to define the line search.  When the   
routine is finished the solution vector <tt> xx</tt>, gradient vector <tt> gg</tt>,   
function value <tt> f</tt>, step size <tt> step</tt>, and <tt> flg</tt> should be  
updated to reflect the new solution.  
<P> 
This routine can be set with the function   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   int <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoSetLineSearch.html#TaoSetLineSearch">TaoSetLineSearch</a>(TAO_SOLVER solver,  
                  int (*setup)(TAO_SOLVER, void*), 
    int (*options)(TAO_SOLVER,void*), 
                  int (*line)(TAO_SOLVER,TaoVec*,TaoVec*,TaoVec*,TaoVec*, 
                           double*,double*,double*,int*,void*), 
                  int (*viewit)(TAO_SOLVER,void*), 
    int (*destroy)(TAO_SOLVER,void*), 
                  void *ctx); 
</tt></pre> 
  
In this routine, the fourth argument is the function pointer to the line  
search routine, and the seventh argument is the pointer that will be passed  
to the line search routine.  The other arguments are optional function   
pointers than can be used to set up, view, and deallocate the solver.
