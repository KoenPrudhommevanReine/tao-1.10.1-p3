<TITLE>Interior Point Newton Algorithm</TITLE>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Node40">25.3. Interior Point Newton Algorithm</a></H2>
The BQPIP algorithm is an interior point algorithm for bound  
constrained quadratic optimization.  It can be set using the  
TaoMethod of <tt> tao_bqpip</tt>.  
Since it assumes the objective function is quadratic,   
it evaluates the function, gradient, and Hessian only once.  
In this algorithm all of the variables are free variables.  
This method also requires the solution of systems of linear equations,  
whose solver can be accessed and modified   
with the command <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoGetLinearSolver.html#TaoGetLinearSolver">TaoGetLinearSolver</a>()</tt>.
