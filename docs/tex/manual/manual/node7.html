<TITLE>Writing Application Codes with TAO</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<HR><H1><A NAME="Node7">7. Writing Application Codes with TAO</a></H1>
The examples throughout the library demonstrate the software usage and  
can serve as templates for developing custom applications.  We suggest  
that new TAO users examine programs in  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   ${TAO_DIR}/src/examples . 
</tt></pre> 
  
Additional examples are available on our website and in  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   ${TAO_DIR}/src/&lt;unconstrained,bound,..&gt;/examples/tutorials, 
</tt></pre> 
  
where <tt> &lt;component&gt;</tt>  
denotes any of the TAO components, such as   
<tt> bound</tt> or <tt> unconstrained</tt>.  
The HTML version of the manual pages located at  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   ${TAO_DIR}/docs/manualpages/index.html 
</tt></pre> 
  
or  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/documentation/manualpages/index.html 
</tt></pre> 
  
provides indices (organized by both routine names and concepts) to the  
tutorial examples.  
<P> 
We suggest the following procedure for writing a new application  
program using TAO:  
<P> 
<ol> 
 
1. Install TAO according to the instructions in  
  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/documentation/index.html.  
 
<BR> 
2. Copy the examples and makefile from the directory  
  <IMG SRC="img7.xbm">
f:  R^n   <IMG SRC="img8.xbm">
R  
where <I>n = 2m</I> is the number of variables.  The code in  
Figure  is only the main program.  We have not  
included the code for evaluating the function and gradient or  
for evaluating the Hessian matrix.  
<P>

<P> 
Note that while we use the C language to introduce the TAO software,  
the package is also fully usable from C++ and Fortran77/90.  
Section  discusses additional issues concerning  
Fortran usage.  
<P> 
The code in Figure  contains many of the components  
needed to write most TAO programs and thus, is illustrative of the  
features present in complex optimization problems.  Note that we have  
omitted the code required for the routine <tt> FormFunctionGradient</tt>,  
which evaluates the function and gradient, and the code for  
<tt> FormHessian</tt>, which evaluates the Hessian matrix for Rosenbrock's  
function.  The following sections annotates the lines of code in  
Figure .
