To create an application object, first  
declare a <tt> TAO_APPLICATION</tt> variable.  
This variable is only a pointer.    
The application object associated with it can be created using  
the routine   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoApplicationCreate.html#TaoApplicationCreate">TaoApplicationCreate</a>(MPI_Comm, TAO_APPLICATION*); 
</tt></pre> 
  
Much like creating PETSc vector and matrix objects,   
the first argument is an MPI <em> communicator</em>.  
An MPI [(ref using-mpi)] communicator  
indicates a collection of processors that will be used to evaluate the  
objective function, compute constraints, and provide derivative information.  
When only one processor is being used, the communicator <tt> MPI_COMM_SELF</tt>  
can be used with no understanding of MPI.  
Even parallel users need to be familiar with only the basic concepts   
of message passing and  distributed-memory computing.   
Most applications running TAO in  
parallel environments can employ the communicator <tt>  
MPI_COMM_WORLD</tt> to indicate all processes in a given run.  
<P> 
The second argument is the address of a  <tt> TAO_APPLICATION</tt> variable.  This  
routine will create a new application object and set the variable, which is a pointer,  
to the address of the object.   This application variable can now be used  
by the developer to define the application and by the   
TAO solver to solve the application.  
<P> 
Elsewhere in this chapter, the <tt> TAO_APPLICATION</tt> variable will be referred  
to as the <em> application object</em>.  
<P> 
After solving the application, the command   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   <a href="../manualpages/ptaopages/TaoAppDestroy.html#TaoAppDestroy">TaoAppDestroy</a>(TAO_APPLICATION); 
</tt></pre> 
  
will destroy the application object and free   
the work space associated with it.
