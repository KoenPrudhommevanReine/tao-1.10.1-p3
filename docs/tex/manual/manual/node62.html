<P> 
<P> 
Currently, TAO users must employ the Fortran file suffix <tt> .F</tt>  
rather than <tt> .f</tt>.  This convention enables use of the CPP  
preprocessor, which allows the use of the <em> #include</em> statements  
that define TAO objects and variables. (Familiarity with the CPP  
preprocessor is not needed for writing TAO Fortran code; one can  
simply begin by copying a TAO Fortran example and its corresponding  
makefile.)    
<P> 
The TAO directory <tt> ${}TAO_DIR/include/finclude</tt>  
contains the Fortran include files  
and should be used via statements   
such as the following:  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>    #include "include/finclude/includefile.h" 
</tt></pre> 
  
Since one must be very careful to include each file no more than once  
in a Fortran routine, application programmers must manually include  
each file needed for the various TAO (or other supplementary)  
components within their program.  This approach differs from the TAO  
C++ interface, where the user need only include the highest level  
file, for example, <tt> tao.h</tt>, which then automatically  
includes all of the required lower level files.  As shown in the  
various Fortran example programs in the TAO distribution, in Fortran  
one must explicitly list <em> each</em> of the include files.
