The TAO design philosophy place strongs emphasis on the reuse of  
external tools where appropriate.  Our design enables bidirectional  
connection to lower-level linear algebra support (e.g. parallel sparse  
matrix data structures) provided in toolkits such as PETSc  
[(ref petsc)] [(ref petsc-user-ref),(ref petsc-web-page)]  
as well as higher-level application  
frameworks.  Our design decisions are strongly motivated by the  
challenges inherent in the use of large-scale distributed memory  
architectures and the reality of working with large and often poorly  
structured legacy codes for specific applications.  Figure  
 illustrates how the TAO software works with external  
libraries and application code.

The TAO solvers use four fundamental objects to define and solve  
optimization problems: vectors, index sets, matrices, and linear  
solvers.  The concepts of vectors and matrices are standard, while an  
index set refers to a set of integers used to identify particular  
elements of vectors or matrices.  An optimization algorithm is a  
sequence of well defined operations on these objects.  These  
operations include vector sums, inner products, and matrix-vector  
multiplication.  TAO makes no assumptions about the representation of  
these objects by passing pointers to data-structure-neutral objects  
for the execution of these numerical operations.  
<P> 
With sufficiently flexible abstract interfaces, TAO can support a  
variety of implementations of data structures and algorithms.  These  
abstractions allow us to more easily experiment with a range of  
algorithmic and data structure options for realistic problems, such as  
within this case study.  Such capabilities are critical for making  
high-performance optimization software adaptable to the continual  
evolution of parallel and distributed architectures and the research  
community's discovery of new algorithms that exploit their features.  
<P> 
Our current TAO implementation uses the parallel system  
infrastructure and linear algebra objects offered by PETSc,  
which uses MPI [(ref using-mpi)] for all interprocessor communication.  
The PETSc package supports objects for vectors, matrices, index   
sets, and linear solvers.  
<P> 
The TAO design philosophy eliminates some of the barriers in using  
independently developed software components by accepting data that is  
independent of representation and calling sequence written for  
particular data formats.  The user can initialize an application with  
external frameworks, provide function information to a TAO solver, and  
call TAO to solve the application problem.  
<P> 
The use of abstractions for matrices and vectors in TAO optimization  
software also enables us to leverage automatic differentiation  
technology to facilitate the parallel computation of gradients and  
Hessians needed within optimization algorithms.  We have demonstrated  
the viability of this approach through preliminary interfacing between  
TAO solvers and the automatic differentiation tools ADIFOR and ADIC.  
We are currently working on developing TAO interfaces that use special  
problem features (for example, partial separability, stencil  
information) in automatic differentiation computations.
