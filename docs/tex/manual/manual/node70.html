New optimization solvers can be added to TAO.  TAO provides tools for  
facilitate the implementation of a solver.  The advantages of implementing  
a solver using TAO are several.  
<P> 
<ol> 
 
1. TAO includes other optimization solvers with an identical interface,   
so application problems may  
conveniently switch solvers to compare their effectiveness.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
2. TAO provides support for function evaluations and  
derivative information.  It allows for the direct evaluation  
of this information by the application developer,   
and contains limited support for finite difference, and  
allows the uses of matrix-free methods.  
The solvers can obtain this function and derivative information  
through a simple interface  while the details of its computation   
are handled within the toolkit.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
3. TAO provides line searches, convergence  
tests, monitoring routines, and other tools  
which are helpful within an optimization algorithm.  
The availability  
of these tools means that the developers of the optimization  
solver do not have to write these utilities.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
4. TAO offers vectors, matrices, index sets, and linear solvers  
that can be used by the solver.  These objects are standard mathematical  
constructions that have many different implementations.  
The objects may be distributed over multiple processors, restricted to  
a single processor, have a dense representation,   
use a sparse data structure, or vary in many other ways.    
TAO solvers do not need to know how  
these objects are represented or how the operations defined on them  
have been implemented.  Instead, the solvers apply these operations  
through an abstract interface that leaves the details to TAO  
and external libraries.  
This abstraction allows solvers to work seamlessly with a variety  
of data structures while allowing application developers to select   
data structures tailored for their purposes.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
5. TAO supports an interface to PETSc and  
allows the integration of other libraries as well.  
When used with PETSc, TAO provides the user a convenient  
method for setting options at runtime, performance profiling, and debugging.
