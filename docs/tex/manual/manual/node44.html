<TITLE>Semismooth Methods</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<HR><H2><A NAME="Node44">26.1. Semismooth Methods</a></H2>
TAO has two implementations of semismooth algorithms   
[(ref munson.facchinei.ea:semismooth),(ref  deluca.facchinei.ea:semismooth),(ref  
facchinei.fischer.ea:semismooth)] for solving mixed complementarity problems.  
Both are based upon a reformulation of the mixed complementarity problem  
as a nonsmooth system of equations using the <a href="../manualpages/vector/Fischer.html#Fischer">Fischer</a>-Burmeister   
function [(ref fischer:special)].  A nonsmooth Newton method is applied to  
the reformulated system to calculate a solution.  The theoretical properties  
of such methods are detailed in the aforementioned references.  
<P> 
The <a href="../manualpages/vector/Fischer.html#Fischer">Fischer</a>-Burmeister function, <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img121.xbm">
, is defined as,  
<P><IMG WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=15 SRC="img122.xbm"><P>
This function has the following key property  
<P><IMG SRC="img123.xbm"><P>
used when reformulating the mixed complementarity problem the system of   
equations <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img124.xbm">
 where <IMG WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img125.xbm">
.    
The reformulation is defined component-wise as  
<P><IMG WIDTH=311 HEIGHT=65 SRC="img126.xbm"><P>
We note that <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img127.xbm">
 is not differentiable everywhere, but satisfies a  
semismoothness property   
[(ref mifflin:semismooth),(ref  qi:convergence),(ref  qi.sun:nonsmooth)].  Furthermore,  
the natural merit function, <IMG WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=13 SRC="img128.xbm">
, is   
continuously differentiable.  
<P> 
The two semismooth TAO solvers both solve the system <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img129.xbm">
 by applying  
a nonsmooth newton method with a line-search.  We calculate a direction, <I>d<SUP>k</SUP></I>,  
by solving the system <IMG WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img130.xbm">
 where <I>H<SUP>k</SUP></I> is an element of the   
<I>B</I>-subdifferential [(ref qi.sun:nonsmooth)] of <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=7 SRC="img131.xbm">
 at <I>x<SUP>k</SUP></I>.  If the   
direction calculated does not satisfy a suitable descent condition, then   
we use the negative gradient of the merit function, <IMG WIDTH=43 HEIGHT=12 SRC="img132.xbm">
, as   
the search direction.  A standard Armijo search [(ref armijo:minimization)] is  
used to find the new iteration.  Non-monotone searches   
[(ref grippo.lampariello.ea:nonmonotone)] are also available by setting   
appropriate run-time options.  See Section  for further   
details.  
<P> 
The first semismooth algorithm available in TAO is not guaranteed to   
remain feasible with respect to the bounds, <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img133.xbm">
, and is termed   
an infeasible semismooth method.  This method can be specified using the   
TaoMethod <tt> tao_ssils</tt>.  In this case, the descent test used is   
that  
<P><IMG WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=13 SRC="img134.xbm"><P>
Both <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=8 SRC="img135.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img136.xbm">
 can be modified using the  
run-time commands <tt> -tao_ssils_delta &lt;delta&gt;</tt> and   
<tt> -tao_ssils_rho &lt;rho&gt;</tt> respectively. By default,   
<IMG WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img137.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img138.xbm">
.  
<P> 
An alternative is to remain feasible with respect to the bounds by using a   
projected Armijo line-search.  This method can be specified using the   
TaoMethod <tt> tao_ssfls</tt>.  The descent test used is the same as above   
where the direction in this case corresponds to the first part of the   
piece-wise linear arc searched by the projected line-search.    
Both <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=8 SRC="img139.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img140.xbm">
 can be modified using the run-time   
commands  <tt> -tao_ssfls_delta &lt;delta&gt;</tt> and <tt> -tao_ssfls_rho &lt;rho&gt;</tt>   
respectively.  By default, <IMG WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img141.xbm">
 and <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=9 SRC="img142.xbm">
.  
<P> 
The recommended algorithm is the infeasible semismooth method,  
<tt> tao_ssils</tt>, because of its strong global and local convergence   
properties.  However, if it is known that <I>F</I> is not defined outside   
of the box, <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=11 SRC="img143.xbm">
, perhaps due to the presence of <I>log</I> functions,  
the feasible algorithm, <tt> tao_ssfls</tt>, is a reasonable alternative.
