One of the most computationally intensive phases of many optimization  
algorithms involves the solution of systems of linear equations.    
The performance  
of the linear solver may be critical to an efficient computation  
of the solution.  
Since linear equation solvers often have a wide variety of options   
associated with them, TAO allows the user to access the linear  
solver with the command

With access to the KSP object, users can customize it for their application  
to achieve additional performance.
