Writing an application using the <tt> TAO_APPLICATION</tt> object may require  
use of an <em> application context</em>.  
An application context is a structure or object defined by an  
application developer, passed  
into a routine also written by the application developer,   
and used within the routine to perform its stated task.  
 <P> 
For example, a routine that evaluates an objective function may need  
parameters, work vectors, and other information.   This information,  
which may be specific to an application and necessary to evaluate the objective,  
can be collected in a single structure and used as one of the  
arguments in the routine.  
The address of this structure will be cast as type <tt> (void*)</tt> and passed to  
the routine in the final argument.  
There are many examples of these structures in the TAO distribution.  
<P> 
This technique offers several advantages.  
In particular, it allows for a uniform interface between TAO and   
the applications.   The fundamental information needed by TAO   
appears in the arguments of the routine, while data specific to an application  
and its implementation is confined to an opaque pointer.  
The routines can access information created outside the   
local scope without the use of global variables.  
The TAO solvers and application objects will never access this structure,   
so the application developer has complete freedom to define it.  In fact,  
these contexts are completely optional -- a NULL pointer can be used.
