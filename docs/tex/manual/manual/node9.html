<TITLE>TAO Initialization</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<HR><H1><A NAME="Node9">9. TAO Initialization</a></H1>
  
<P> 
All TAO programs contain a call to   
<BR> 
<pre><tt>   info = <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoInitialize.html#TaoInitialize">TaoInitialize</a>(int *argc,char ***argv,char *file_name,  
                        char *help_message); 
</tt></pre> 
   
This command initializes TAO (and also MPI and PETSc if these have not  
yet been initialized elsewhere).  The arguments <tt> argc</tt> and  
<tt> argv</tt> are the command line arguments delivered in all C and  
C++ programs.  The argument  
<tt> file_name</tt> optionally indicates an alternative name for an  
options file, which by default is called <tt> .petscrc</tt> and resides  
in the user's home directory.  See the PETSc users manual for details  
regarding runtime option specification.  The final argument,  
<tt> help_message</tt>, is an optional character string that will be  
printed if the program is run with the <tt> -help</tt> option.  
<P> 
As illustrated by the <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoInitialize.html#TaoInitialize">TaoInitialize</a>()</tt> statement above, TAO  
routines return an integer indicating whether an error has occurred  
during the call.  The error code is set to be nonzero if an error has  
been detected; otherwise, it is zero.  For the C or C++ interface, the  
error variable is the routine's return value, while for the Fortran  
version, each TAO routine has as its final argument an integer error  
variable.  Error tracebacks are discussed in  
Section .
