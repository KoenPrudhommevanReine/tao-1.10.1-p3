<TITLE>TAO Interface with Solvers</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<HR><H1><A NAME="Node71">47. TAO Interface with Solvers</a></H1>
TAO solvers must be written in C++ and include several routines with  
a particular calling sequence.  Two of these routines are mandatory:  
one that initializes the TAO structure with the appropriate information  
and one that applies the algorithm to a problem instance.  
Additional routines may be written to set some options within the  
solver, view the solver, setup appropriate data structures, and destroy  
these data structures.  
In each of these routines except the initialization routine,   
there are two arguments.    
<P> 
The first argument  
is always the TAO structure.  This structure may be used to obtain the  
vectors used to store the variables and the function gradient, evaluate  
a function and gradient, solve a set of linear equations, perform a line   
search, and apply a convergence test.  
<P> 
The second argument is specific to this solver.  This pointer will be set  
in  the initialization routine and cast to an appropriate type in  
the other routines.  To implement the Fletcher - Reeves conjugate  
gradient algorithm, for instance, the following structure may  
be useful.  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>typedef struct{ 
 
  double beta; 
 
  TaoVec *gg; 
  TaoVec *dx;   /* step direction */ 
  TaoVec *ww;   /* work vector    */ 
 
} TAO_CG; 
</tt></pre> 
This structure contains two work vectors and a scalar.  Vectors  
for the solution and gradient are not needed here because the TAO  
structure has pointers to them.
