<TITLE>TAO Applications using PETSc and FORTRAN</TITLE>

<P> 
Most of the functionality of TAO can be obtained by people who program  
purely in Fortran 77 or Fortran 90.  Note, however, that we recommend  
the use of C and/or C++ because these languages contain several  
extremely powerful concepts that the Fortran77/90 family does not.  
The TAO Fortran interface works with both F77 and F90 compilers.  
<P> 
Since Fortran77 does not provide type checking of routine input/output  
parameters, we find that many errors encountered within TAO Fortran  
programs result from accidentally using incorrect calling sequences.  
Such mistakes are immediately detected during compilation when using  
C/C++.  Thus, using a mixture of C/C++ and Fortran often works well  
for programmers who wish to employ Fortran for the core numerical  
routines within their applications.  In particular, one can  
effectively write TAO driver routines in C++, thereby preserving  
flexibility within the program, and still use Fortran when desired for  
underlying numerical computations.  
<P> 
<P> 
Only a few differences exist between the C and Fortran TAO interfaces,  
all of which are due to differences in Fortran syntax.  All Fortran  
routines have the same names as the corresponding C versions, and  
command line options are fully supported. The routine arguments follow  
the usual Fortran conventions; the user need not worry about passing  
pointers or values.  The calling sequences for the Fortran version are  
in most cases identical to the C version, except for the error  
checking variable discussed in Section .  In  
addition, the Fortran routine <tt> <a href="../manualpages/solver/TaoInitialize.html#TaoInitialize">TaoInitialize</a>(char *filename,int info)</tt>  
differs slightly from its C counterpart; see the manual page for  
details.
