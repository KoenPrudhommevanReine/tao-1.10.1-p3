The initial development of TAO was funded by the ACTS Toolkit Project in  
the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, U.S. Department  
of Energy. We gratefully acknowledge their support.  
<P> 
TAO owes much to the developers of PETSc. We have benefitted  
from their experience, tools, software, and advice. In many ways, TAO is a   
natural outcome of the PETSc development.  
TAO has also benefitted from the work of various researchers  
who have provided solvers, test problems, and interfaces.  
In particular, we acknowledge  
<P> 
<ul> 
  
 
<li>Lisa Grignon for contributing the least squares examples  
<tt> chebyq.c</tt>, <tt> coating.c</tt>  and <tt> enzreac1.c</tt>;  
 
<li>Yurii Zinchenko and Mike Gertz for the interface to  
the OOQP solver for quadratic problems with linear constraints;  
 
<li>Liz Dolan for developing the HTML version of the TAO user guide  
 
<li>Boyana Norris for developing prototype CCA-compliant   
optimization component interfaces.  
 
<li>Gabriel Lopez-Calva for integrating ADIC with TAO on Distributed  
Array applications and developing examples that use them; and  
 
<li>Jarek Nieplocha, Limin Zhang, and Manojkumar Krishnan for the  
interface between Global Arrays and TAO and implemented example  
applications.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
  
Finally, we thank all TAO users for their comments, bug reports, and  
encouragement.
