NAME
    TaoOoqp - A interface between TAO and OOQP, a package for solving
    convex quadratic programming problems.

SYNOPSIS
    This directory contains an interface between TAO, the Toolkit for
    Advanced Optimization, and OOQP, a package for solving convex
    quadratic programming problems (QP). These are optimization
    problems in which the objective function is a convex quadratic
    function and the constraints are linear functions of a vector of
    real variables. They have the following general form:

        minimize (1/2) * x' * Q * x + c' * x
        subject to                     A * x  = b
                                l_c <= C * x <= u_c
                                l_x <=     x <= u_x

    where Q is a symmetric positive semi-definite n by n matrix, x is
    a n-vector of variables, A and C are matrices of dimensions m_a by
    n and m_c by n, respectively, and c, b, l_c, u_c, l_x and u_x are
    vectors of appropriate dimensions.

OBTAINING TAO

GETTING STARTED
    The file INSTALL, included in this directory, is the installation
    guide for the TaoOoqp package. Documentation for the TaoOoqp
    interface may be found in the TAO manual.

    Additional information about OOQP can be found in the OOQP Users
    Guide which may be obtained from the OOQP web page
    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp.
